WunderFocus
===========

A Google Chrome extension to focus on the current task in Wunderlist. Inspired by nowdothis.com.

How to use
----------

1. Install extension.
2. Visit a list in your Wunderlist account.
3. Press button.

Why
---

I like nowdothis.com's simplicity. But it stores tasks only locally and you cannot e.g. resume a list on another device. The latter is something you can do with full-fledged task list managers such as Wunderlist... but then again, these are too fully fledged.

This Chrome extension converts the viewport of Wunderlist into a simple screen.
